Section existential.
  (** Since extending our language with records would be tedious,
    we encode records using nested pairs.

   For instance, we would represent the record type
   { add : Int → Int → Int; sub : Int → Int → Int; neg : Int → Int }
   as (Int → Int → Int) × (Int → Int → Int) × (Int → Int).

   Similarly, we would represent the record value
   { add := λ: "x" "y", "x" + "y";
     sub := λ: "x" "y", "x" - "y";
     neg := λ: "x", #0 - "x"
   }
  as the nested pair
  ((λ: "x" "y", "x" + "y",    (* add *)
    λ: "x" "y", "x" - "y"),   (* sub *)
    λ: "x", #0 - "x").        (* neg *)
